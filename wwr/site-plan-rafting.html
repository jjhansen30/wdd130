    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This website is needed because there are people like me who want to water raft but is unsure of what aeras
      are appropriate for my skill level. So far there are no websites that grant this information, meaning people have
      to get the information by word of mouth. We need a website that houses all of the locations in to one easy to
      use spot so everyone can quickly look at what is nearby or even plan for trips in another country.
      When this website is created the goal is for everyone, no matter their skill level, to have access to all of the
      great water rafting locations. When a user uses this site they will be able to gain information about the location,
      how difficult it is, as well as thoughts from those who have been there.
      As a result of users using this site, they will need to find the proper equipment to raft.
      The goal is for these people to purchase goods from various rafting companies. Doing this will help sustain,
      if not grow, the outdoor market specialized in rafting.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>When thinking of water rafting I think of a river surrounded by a forest.
      As such the following colors will be used: primary #528540, secondary #CDDE47, accent1 #DE7047, accent2 #FFFFFF.
      These colors give a forest sort of feeling so those coming to the website will feel as though the aesthetic fits their expectations.
      Much of water rafting is done on rivers, which wind and weave. Not to mention the waves that can come up.
      Because of this the heading font will be more of a handwritten type called Permanent Marker.
      The paragraph font will keep to a more formal format with sans-sarif called Poppins so that users
      will not have a hard reading the content. Both fonts combined should give the user an experience that
      both says fun with a mix of professionalism. Since this website is designed to help all water rafters
      regardless of proficiency this website should be easy for everyone to see where the best water rafting
      places are at as well as how difficult it is. Users will also see a review section. This section will
      house reviews from those who have rafted in that location. The hope is that they will share tips and tricks
      about their experience there so that others who have not been to that location can be even more prepared.
